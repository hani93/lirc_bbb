lirc_bbb
========================
This is kernel version 3.8.13 with RobertCNelson's patches,
where i try to add support for LIRC, by porting RaspBerry Pi's "lirc_rpi" driver for BeagleBone Black.

So far, only receiving part is working on "P9_12".
(There is also output pin defined "P9_14", but i'll look more into this, that why it isn't working.)
